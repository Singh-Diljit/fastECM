# fastECM
Implementation of Lenstraâ€™s ECM to factor large composite numbers. This is a faster implementation of ECM than the class oriented version also found on my gitHub.

## Example
```python
N = (3209622181 * 6727426213 * 2810645183)
print(lenstraFactorial(N))
>>> 2810645183 #Takes ~ (0.5822016000020085 seconds)
```
